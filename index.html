          <h3> First Attack</h3>
          <p>His first attack that is known was on January of 1974, against an 18 year old woman named Karen Sparks who
            attended the University of Washington. He broke into her apartment beat and raped her leaving her with
            severe brain damage but she luckily survived </p>

          <h3>Becoming a Killer</h3>
          <p>Growing up Ted Bundy experienced a lot of trauma and when asked about by reporters he made it out to seem
            like everything was perfect for him growing up. He always had a lot of anger and emotion built up and it
            kept building with the breakup of him and his girlfriend Diane which messed him up badly causing him to want
            to get “some sort of revenge”. The fact that all of his victims closely resembled her is believed to be one
            of the main things that led him to begin killing people.

          <a href="#" class="close">&times;</a>
          <h3>First Kill</h3>
          <p>His first known killing was 1 month later of february first 1974 when he killed a student of the University
            of Washington named Lynda Ann Healy and he broke into her apartment, kidnapped her, raped her, and beat her
            to death. In the same year between January and July it is believed that he killed 8+ women in seattle.

          <a href="#" class="close">&times;</a>
          <h3>Methods</h3>
          <p> He would watch his victims to observe patterns, lure his victims to his car or he would fake an injury and
            or the need of emergency services, or he would convince them they were in danger and offer to walk them to
            their car, or he would just draw them to his car by conversing with them. He would then bring them somewhere
            where he would proceed to rape them and beat them to death with the use of blunt weapons like clubs,
            crowbars, tree branches, etc. <br><br>
            <br>After his first murders and as he continued commiting crime he began to be a lot less organized with a
            shorter cool down period between murders and he also began strangling his victims rather than just killing
            with the use of blunt force trauma.

          <h3>Locations</h3>
          <p>Bundy originally started killing in his home state at the time of washington and when he went to law school
            at the University of Utah he was still killing. However people eventually started to catch on to him he
            moved again and again and killed wherever he went. These states include Idaho, Colorado and Florida where he
            was finally caught and his killing came to an end.</p>

          <h3>Avoiding the Police</h3>
          <p>Although he killed a lot of people he avoided being caught over a period of about four years(1974-1978). It
            was difficult to catch him due to his very strong ability to blend in with his surroundings and he was very
            smart. He also had a very good reputation which only increased his ability to blend in enabling him to kill
            undetected for a while.

          <h3>How he got caught</h3>
          <p>When he was finally caught in Pensacola, Florida on February 15, 1978 after killing all of his victims, he
            was in Florida which was his fifth killing state where people were reporting someone named “Ted” being the
            reason for the disappearance of many women. Many people reported him himself including his own girlfriend at
            the time. Eventually he killed two sorority girls at their house and he also had a dead 12 year old girl in
            his car when he got caught. He got booked for the three murders and he received the death sentence.</p>
